These are basically notes to myself on preparing a new
distribution of NTL.


Notes on making a new distribution

- change version numbers in ../include/NTL/version.h, DIRNAME, and WINDIR

- change the libtool soname in VERSION_INFO. See:

http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html

- if changes were made to makefile or ../include/NTL/config.h, 
  make sure these changes are implemented in the template files 
  mfile and cfile, and then run:

./configure
cp makefile def_makefile
cp ../include/NTL/config.h ../include/NTL/def_config.h

- run:  

make package
make winpack
